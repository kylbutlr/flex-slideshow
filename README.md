# Flex Slideshow
### Javascript image slideshow using flexbox.

Created as a landing page but could also be used in a window.

Upon loading, as long as the cursor does not move, the slideshow will begin by "flexing" open each picture, pausing for a moment, and then closing back to normal before moving onto another random picture.

If the cursor moves, the slideshow will pause and allow for any picture to be opened.

If at any point the cursor stops moving for ~10 seconds, the slideshow will begin again.
