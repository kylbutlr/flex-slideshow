# Flex Slideshow

This is an example of a "flex" slideshow, a Javascript image slideshow using CSS3's flexbox property.


Initially, just a window with around 4 - 16 pictures that are all shrunk horizontally. Upon loading, as long as the cursor does not move, the slideshow will begin by "flexing" open a randomly selected picture, pausing for a moment, and then closing back to normal before moving onto another random picture.

If the cursor moves, the slideshow will pause and allow for any picture to be opened.

If at any point the cursor stops moving for ~10 seconds, the slideshow will begin again.
